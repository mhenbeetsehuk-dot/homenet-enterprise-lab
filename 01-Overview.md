\# HOMENET Lab – Overview



This project was designed to simulate a real enterprise IT environment in which centralized identity, networking, and security services are architected, deployed, and operated by an administrator.



Rather than relying on pre-built images or guided lab exercises, the environment was built from the ground up to ensure a deep, practical understanding of how each component functions individually and how they integrate within a production-style infrastructure.



\## Purpose and Scope



The primary objective of the HOMENET lab is to replicate real-world scenarios commonly encountered by Network Engineers, SysOps Engineers, and DevOps Engineers. These scenarios include, but are not limited to:



\- Firewalling and network segmentation

\- DNS dependency and name resolution failures

\- Kerberos-based authentication flows

\- Centralized user and group management

\- Service dependency troubleshooting

\- Diagnosing and correcting configuration errors



The lab environment prioritises understanding \*\*design decisions, operational behaviour, and failure modes\*\*, rather than simply achieving a working configuration.



\## Design Philosophy



This project reflects an enterprise mindset where:

\- Infrastructure services are interdependent

\- Misconfigurations are expected and must be diagnosed

\- Documentation and validation are as important as deployment

\- Systems are designed with scalability and maintainability in mind



The HOMENET lab serves both as a technical learning platform and as a demonstrable reference environment for enterprise infrastructure design and operations.
