# HOMENET Enterprise Infrastructure Lab

The HOMENET Enterprise Infrastructure Lab is a self-designed and fully implemented simulation of a real-world corporate network and identity environment. The project was built to gain practical, hands-on experience with enterprise networking, centralized authentication, and systems administration using industry-standard tools and architectures.

The lab includes a routed and firewalled internal network, a Samba-based Active Directory Domain Controller, integrated DNS and Kerberos authentication, and structured user and group management following role-based access control principles. The environment is hosted using VMware Workstation and is designed to closely mirror how small-to-medium enterprises deploy and operate Microsoft-style identity and network services.
