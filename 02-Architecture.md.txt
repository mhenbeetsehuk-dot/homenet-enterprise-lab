The architecture of the HOMENET lab follows common enterprise design principles. VMware Workstation was selected as the virtualization platform to allow isolation of the lab environment while maintaining usability on a single physical workstation. A virtual pfSense firewall was deployed to act as the network gateway, providing routing, NAT, and DHCP services in a manner consistent with real perimeter firewalls.

An Ubuntu Server system was chosen to host the Active Directory Domain Controller using Samba. This approach was intentionally selected over a Windows-based DC to ensure a strong understanding of the underlying components of Active Directory, including LDAP, Kerberos, and DNS. The architecture separates concerns between networking, identity, and client systems, mirroring production environments used by organisations.
