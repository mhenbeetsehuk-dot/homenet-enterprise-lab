The network design for the HOMENET lab uses a clearly defined private address space to represent an internal corporate LAN. The primary subnet, 192.168.10.0/24, is routed through a pfSense firewall which serves as the default gateway and enforces network boundaries. This design allows full control of traffic flow and provides a realistic platform for learning firewall and routing behaviour.

DNS resolution within the environment is intentionally directed to the Active Directory Domain Controller, reflecting enterprise best practices. External DNS resolution is forwarded upstream only after internal name resolution is completed. This design reinforces the critical dependency between DNS and identity services and provides a controlled environment for troubleshooting authentication and connectivity issues.
